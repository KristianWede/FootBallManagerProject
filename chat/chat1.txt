I need some dummydata.
This is my assignment description "Football leagues in Denmark is organised in tiers. The first tier (SuperLigaen) use the same tournament style as the second tier (NordicBetLigaen), which mean that handling scores is done in a uniform manner.

 

Each tier is composed of 12 teams, that play internally between themselves in 22 rounds, after which the tier is split into an upper and lower fraction, each consisting of 6 teams. Each fraction then play internally between themselves in 10 additional rounds, after which the table is then finished.

 

Your job is to implement a football processor application, that based on a lot of comma-separated files inside a directory can process and print the necessary information on the console as well as into a result file in the same directory.

 

There could be any number of files available, depending on the current data, so the processor should process any number of files from one end to the other, and after processing each file it must present the current table standings of the league. The files are all csv files (Comma Separated Values), so they can be edited in a spreadsheet easily."

i need a setup.csv file
The setup file contain a line on the league setup, such as

League name
Number of positions to promote to Champions league 
(usually 1 in Superligaen, 0 in NordicBetLigaen, they have promotions instead)
Number of subsequent positions to promote to Europe league
Number of subsequent positions to promote to Conference League
Number of positions to promote to an upper league 
(when the above is all zero, these ones are show, so 2 in NordicBetLigaen, 0 in Superligaen)
Number of final positions that are to be relegated into a lower league (usually 2)
ChatGPT
Certainly, here's a sample setup.csv file for your football league processing application based on the provided assignment description:

csv
Copy code
League name,Number of positions to promote to Champions league,Number of subsequent positions to promote to Europe league,Number of subsequent positions to promote to Conference League,Number of positions to promote to an upper league,Number of final positions that are to be relegated into a lower league
SuperLigaen,1,2,3,0,2
NordicBetLigaen,0,0,0,2,2
You can use this CSV file as a starting point for your application's configuration, and you can modify the values as needed to match the specific league setup you're working with. Make sure to place this setup.csv file in the same directory as your other CSV files for processing.
